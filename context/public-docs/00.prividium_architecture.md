## Prividium™ Core Components

### User Panel

Vue 3 application for users to:

- Authenticate via OIDC or Web3 wallet.
- Associate wallets and manage user profile.
- View assigned permissions.

### Prividium™ API

Fastify-based backend service providing:

**REST API:**

- Authentication via OIDC and Web3 (SIWE)
- User, role, and permission management
- Contract and template configuration

**RPC Proxy:**

- Permission-enforced JSON-RPC proxy to ZKsync node
- Wallet RPC for per-user RPC URLs

**Permission System (PostgreSQL):**

- Role-based access control
- Method-level contract permissions with argument validation
- Event-level permissions
- Reusable permission templates

### Admin Panel

Vue 3 application for administrators to:

- Manage contract metadata and permissions
- Configure method-level permissions with argument validation
- Assign user roles and manage user-role relationships

### Prividium™ Block Explorer

Specialized implementation of the ZKsync Block Explorer for Prividium™ authentication and privacy support.

For more details, please refer to ZKsync Block Explorer [repository](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer).

### Prividium™ SDK & CLI

A TypeScript SDK and CLI for integrating with the Prividium™ authorization system.

**SDK:**

- Popup-based OAuth authentication
- Token management with automatic expiration handling
- Viem transport with auth headers
- Wallet integration (network setup, transaction authorization)

**CLI:**

- Local authenticated JSON-RPC proxy (`prividium proxy`)
- Configuration management

See: [Prividium™ SDK & CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prividium).

## Example Flow: User accessing a contract function with restricted access

1. **Client** makes RPC call via dApp, wallet or Explorer.
2. **SDK** adds access token to Authorization header
3. **Prividium™ API** Receives RPC call and performs authorization check based on the configured permissions for the
   contract function stored in the **Prividium™ Permission System Database**.
4. If authorized, **Prividium™ API** forwards requests to ZKsync node.
5. **Prividium™ API** applies response filtering based on user permissions.
6. **Prividium™ API** returns filtered response to client.
