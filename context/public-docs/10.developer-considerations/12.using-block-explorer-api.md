title: Using the Block Explorer API
description: Learn how to authenticate and interact with the Prividium Block Explorer API.
---

The Prividium Block Explorer provides a REST API for querying blockchain data such as transactions, accounts, blocks,
and contracts. Like other Prividium services, the API requires authentication.

## Authentication

The Block Explorer API uses the same authentication mechanism as other Prividium services. You must obtain an access
token using the [SIWE authentication flow](/docs/developer-considerations/programmatic-token-management) and include it
as a Bearer token in your requests.

> [!IMPORTANT] IMPORTANT
>
> The Block Explorer API requires admin role permissions. Contact your network administrator if you need access.

### Request Headers

| Header          | Value                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <access-token>` |

## API Documentation

The full API documentation is available at your Block Explorer API service:

```
https://<your-block-explorer-api>/docs
```

This Swagger UI provides interactive documentation for all available endpoints.

## Example Request

```bash
# First, obtain a token using the SIWE flow (see programmatic token management guide)
TOKEN="your-access-token"

# Query the API with the Bearer token
curl -X GET "https://block-explorer-api.prividium.dev/api/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Example with JavaScript

```typescript
const BLOCK_EXPLORER_API = 'https://block-explorer-api.prividium.dev';

async function queryBlockExplorer(token: string, endpoint: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`${BLOCK_EXPLORER_API}${endpoint}`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
  return response.json();
}

// Usage
const stats = await queryBlockExplorer(token, '/api/stats');
const transactions = await queryBlockExplorer(token, '/transactions');
```
